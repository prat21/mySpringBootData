How did I imported my custom jar "test-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar" in maven dependencies?

1. Put the customer jar in some location, say in desktop
2. Run the following maven command from commandline (the location from where you run the command does not matter),

	mvn install:install-file -Dfile=C:\Users\pratik\Desktop\test.jar -DgroupId=com.java -DartifactId=test -Dversion=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackaging=jar
	
This command will install the your jar in the local repo (C:\Users\pratik\.m2\repository) under the folder hierarchy:

	com\java\test\1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
	
The folder hierarchy is taken as {groupId}\{artifactId}\{version}

3. To use the jar in some project, put the following entry in pom.xml and build the project:
		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.java</groupId>
			<artifactId>test</artifactId>
			<version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>		
		</dependency>
The jar will be imported in maven dependencies. Note that you can always get the pom dependency entry from the pom.xml present in the
C:\Users\pratik\.m2\repository\com\java\test\1.0.0-SNAPSHOT folder.
